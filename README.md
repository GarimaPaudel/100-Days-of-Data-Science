## Day 2 - Conditionals and Loops
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Conditionalsüîó:
    - Utilizing the if statement to execute code based on a condition.
    - Employing elif to add more conditions to the decision-making process.
    - Falling back on the else statement for actions when no conditions are met.

   - For loops to iterate through sequences like lists, tuples, and more.
   - range() function for controlled iterations.
   - Embracing the efficiency of while loops for repeated execution until a condition becomes false.

## Day 3 - Python's Fundamental Data Structures
- 1Ô∏è‚É£  Lists: mutable data structure, changeable, ordered sequence of elements inside square brackets[ ].
   - Explored the versatile world of lists
   - dynamic arrays that can hold a mix of data types.
   - Used functions like 'len()', sum(), max(), min(), sorted()`append()`, `insert()`,'extend()', `remove()` , etc. to manipulate elements.
   -  Performed slicing techniques.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£  Tuples: Dived into the immutable realm of tuples
   - inside  brackets().
   - similar to lists, but their values cannot be changed after creation and doesnot support item reassignment.
   - Perfect for protecting important data!
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.
   -  In python, dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
   - Elements are in the form of key-value pairs.
   -  Provides fast data retrieval.
   - Learned to add, modify, and access elements using keys.
   -  Also learned about nested dictionaries.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sets: Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
   - Python's set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.
   - This is based on a data structure known as hash table.
   - Explored the world of sets, unordered collections of unique elements.
   - Utilized functions like `add()`, 'clear()', `remove()`, issubset() etc. ,
   - Set operations like union, difference and intersection.
   - Eliminates duplicates.

## Day 4 - Functions is Python
 - 1Ô∏è‚É£ Defining Functions: Functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by a name and parentheses. They can take parameters, which are placeholders for data we'll use inside the function.
 - 2Ô∏è‚É£  Function Calls: We call functions by using their names followed by parentheses. We can pass arguments to functions, which are the actual data we want to operate on.
 - 3Ô∏è‚É£ Return Statements: Functions can return values using the return statement. This allows us to capture the output of a function and use it elsewhere in our code.
 - 4Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Arguments: Functions can have üîπ Default Arguments üîπ Positional Arguments üîπ Keyword Arguments üîπ Arbitary Arguments
 - 5Ô∏è‚É£ Variable Scope: I learned about the concept of variable scope. Variables defined inside a function have local scope, while those defined outside have global scope. It's essential to understand how scope affects variable accessibility.
 - 6Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda Functions: I explored lambda functions, which are concise, anonymous functions often used for simple operations. They're created using the lambda keyword.
 - 7Ô∏è‚É£ Recursion: I delved into recursive functions, where a function calls itself. It's a powerful technique that can be used to solve complex problems.

## Day 5 - Object Oriented Concepts
 - üî∑ Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable, self-contained objects. These objects are instances of classes, which are essentially blueprints for creating objects.
 - üî∑ Python is a versatile and popular programming language that supports OOP principles.
 - 1Ô∏è‚É£ Classes and Objects: I gained insights into the essence of classes as blueprints for creating objects. This paradigm allows me to encapsulate data and behavior within elegant structures.
 - 2Ô∏è‚É£ Attributes and Methods: The foundation of OOP, attributes hold data while methods define actions. This modular approach enhances code organization and readability.
 - 3Ô∏è‚É£ Constructors: With the __init__ method, I unlocked the ability to initialize objects and set their initial attributes right upon creation.
 - 4Ô∏è‚É£ Destructors: Managing resource cleanup is crucial, and the __del__ method lets me take care of that when objects are no longer needed.
 - 5Ô∏è‚É£ str() Function: This function lets me customize how an object is represented as a string, enhancing clarity and debugging.
 - 6Ô∏è‚É£ Inheritance: The concept of creating specialized classes, derived from existing ones, fascinated me. It promotes code reuse and empowers me to build hierarchies of related classes.
 - 7Ô∏è‚É£ Access Modifiers: I explored the world of access modifiers, including public, private, and protected member access. These modifiers offer a structured way to control interaction with class attributes and methods.

## Day 6 - More Object Oriented Concepts
 - 1Ô∏è‚É£ Method Overriding: Method overriding is the ability of a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
 - 2Ô∏è‚É£ Method Resolution Order(MRO): Method Resolution Order determines the sequence in which classes are searched for a requested method. It follows the C3 linearization algorithm.
 - 3Ô∏è‚É£ Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, leading to code that can work with objects of multiple types. It means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types.
 - 4Ô∏è‚É£ Duck Typing: Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior (methods and properties) rather than its explicit type.
 - 5Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation: It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.

## Day 7 - Exception Handling and File Handling
 - 1Ô∏è‚É£ Exception Handling: An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It can be caused by various reasons, such as invalid input, resource unavailability, or unexpected behavior.
     - Try-Except Block: The primary mechanism to handle exceptions in Python is the try-except block. It allows us to wrap a block of code that might raise exceptions, and then specify how to handle those exceptions.
     - Else Clause: The else clause can be added after all except clauses and will execute if no exception occurs within the try block.
     - Finally Clause: The finally clause is used to specify code that will be executed no matter what, whether an exception occurred or not.
     - Raising Exceptions: You can explicitly raise exceptions using the raise statement. This is useful when you want to signal an error condition yourself.
     - Custom Exceptions: We can create our own custom exception classes by inheriting from existing exception classes. This can help us categorize and handle specific errors in our code.
 - 2Ô∏è‚É£ File Handling
     -  Opening and Closing Files:
        - open() function: Used to open a file, it returns a file object.
        - close() method: Used to close the file when you're done with it.
    - File Modes:
       -  'r': Read mode (default).
       - 'w': Write mode, truncating the file if it already exists.
       - a': Append mode, adding data to the end of the file if it exists.
       - 'x': Exclusive creation mode, creating a new file if it doesn't exist.
       - 'b': Binary mode, used for working with binary files.
       - 't': Text mode (default), used for working with text files.
    - Reading from Files:
       - read(): Reads the entire content of the file.
       -  readline(): Reads a single line from the file.
       -  readlines(): Reads all lines into a list.
    - Writing to Files:
      - write(): Writes a string to the file.
      -  writelines(): Writes a list of strings to the file.
    - Context Managers (with Statement): A safer way to handle files using the with statement. It automatically handles opening and closing of the file.

## Day 8 - NumPy
  -  Advantages of NumPy over Python Lists: NumPy offers lightning-fast array operations and efficient memory usage, making it a go-to choice for numerical computations and data manipulation.
  -  Key Functions and Attributes: I got hands-on with np.array() to create arrays, and explored attributes like array.shape() and array.size for shape and size information. The dtype attribute helped me manage data types effortlessly.
  -  Array Manipulation: I learned to manipulate arrays with functions like transpose, np.empty, np.ones, and np.arange(). Reshaping arrays using array.reshape(), array.flatten(), and array.ravel() proved incredibly useful for data restructuring.
  -  Array Slicing and Indexing: NumPy's array slicing capabilities blew my mind! From extracting specific elements to working with slices, I've gained a solid understanding of accessing and manipulating array data.
  -  Mathematical Operations: I explored functions like np.std(), np.log(), and basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) on arrays.
  -   Trigonometric and String Operations: The library surprised me with its versatility. I experimented with trigonometric functions and even string operations using NumPy arrays.

## Day 9 - Pandas
- Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.It is a powerful Python library that provides data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning tools and is widely used in data science, machine learning, and any data-related tasks. I leant about:
  -  Constructing DataFrames
  -  Concept of csv data and working with them
  -  Indexing using column name, rowindex and rowindex, column index and Slicing
  -  Find null values
  -  several functions like head(), tail(), describe(), info(),isnull(), value_counts(), unique(), and so on.
  
## Day 10 - More Pandas
 - With the read_json() function, I've been able to effortlessly load JSON data into Pandas dataframes, providing me with a structured, tabular format to work with. And there is also to_json() method and it lets me seamlessly convert Pandas dataframes back into JSON format, making data exchange a breeze.
 - One tool that has truly dazzled me is the json_normalize() function. It's like having a decoder for nested JSON structures! This function flattens nested JSON data into a neat and tidy dataframe
 - Also ventured into Pandas' read_html() function. With this gem, I can effortlessly extract HTML tables from web pages and transform them into Pandas dataframes. This is an invaluable skill for converting messy web data into structured, analyzable formats. Plus, the to_html() method allows me to reverse the process, seamlessly converting dataframes back into HTML tables.

## Day 11 - Handling Null Values
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Deletion or Removal:
  -  Listwise Deletion: It implies removing entire rows with at least one null value. I realized that this approach is suitable when the null values are relatively rare and not systematically distributed. We use .dropna() to do this.
.dropna(axis = 0) for deletion of rows
  - Column Dropping: If a column contains a high proportion of null values and is not crucial for analysis, you can consider dropping the column altogether.
.dropna(axis = 1) for deletion of columns
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Imputation:
Imputation involves replacing null values with estimated or inferred values. This helps to retain data points and maintain the structure of the dataset.
  -  Mean/Median Imputation: Replace null values with the mean or median of the non-null values in the same column. This method is suitable for numerical data.
  -  Mode Imputation: Replace null values with the mode (most frequent value) of the non-null values in the column. This method is suitable for categorical data.
  -  Interpolation: For time-series or sequential data, null values can be estimated using interpolation methods like linear interpolation.
