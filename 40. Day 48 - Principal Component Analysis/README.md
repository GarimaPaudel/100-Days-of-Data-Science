# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Steps

## Step 1: Standardize the Data

Given a dataset with \(m\) observations and \(n\) features, the first step is to standardize the data by subtracting the mean (\(μ\)) of each feature and dividing by its standard deviation (\(σ\)):

\[Z = \frac{(X - μ)}{σ}\]

## Step 2: Compute the Covariance Matrix

Next, compute the covariance matrix (\(C\)) for the standardized data. The covariance between two features \(i\) and \(j\) is given by:

\[cov(X_i, X_j) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{m}(X_i^k - \bar{X}_i)(X_j^k - \bar{X}_j)}{m-1}\]

The covariance matrix \(C\) is an \(n \times n\) matrix where each element \(C_{ij}\) is the covariance between features \(i\) and \(j\).

## Step 3: Compute Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

Find the eigenvectors (\(v\)) and eigenvalues (\(λ\)) of the covariance matrix:

\[C \cdot v = λ \cdot v\]

## Step 4: Sort Eigenvectors by Eigenvalues

Sort the eigenvectors in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. This step is crucial as it determines the order of importance of the principal components.

## Step 5: Select Principal Components

Choose the top \(k\) eigenvectors to form the transformation matrix \(W\), where \(k\) is the desired number of dimensions in the reduced space.

\[W = \begin{bmatrix}v_1 & v_2 & \ldots & v_k\end{bmatrix}\]

## Step 6: Transform the Data

Multiply the standardized data (\(Z\)) by the transformation matrix \(W\) to obtain the new set of features (\(Y\)) in the reduced dimensional space.

\[Y = Z \cdot W\]

## Final Note

The resulting \(Y\) matrix represents the data in a new coordinate system, and the columns of \(W\) are the principal components. This transformation retains as much variance as possible while reducing the dimensionality of the data.
